\begin{abstract}
  The Curry-Howard isomorphism allows us to express logical propositions as
  types, and proofs of a proposition as functions satisfying said proposition's
  type. \cite{curry-howard} Some dependently typed programming languages, such
  as Coq, leverage this isomorphism to provide a computerized interactive proof
  assistant. \cite{pierce-sf} This paper attempts to present an abstraction
  whereby a computer, equipped with the right information, can ``intuit'' and
  prove its own theorems, with less---or no---help from a human. This paper does
  not attempt to prove whether or not said task is possible and/or plausible, it
  just provides an abstraction that could potentially be used to attack the
  problem.
